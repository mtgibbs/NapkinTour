NapkinTour
==========

Made this script for giving a brief tour of a site while loading images (hopefully soon SVGs) with hand-drawn notes.  It calculates how to line the arrow up according to the direction that the arrow is specified to be pointing at.  Then it will black out the rest of the screen and just highlight the given div id.

Requires jQuery.
